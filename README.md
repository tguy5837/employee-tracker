## Description

This application was developed to help keep track of data regarding a company's employees. The employee-tracker allows the user to quickly and easily view or create employees, departments, and roles! This is a very useful application for any business owner who would like a more streamlined way to organize the business.

## Installation

To use this application, open the employee-tracker folder in VS Code and then open the terminal to the root directory of the employee-tracker. Run npm i to install all dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, run node index.js (make sure you are in root directory) and the application will run.

## Usage

After running node index.js, a menu should appear that allows the user to select from a number of different options. View employees, view roles, view departments, create employee, create role, create department, update employee role, and exit. Choosing one of the create options will prompt the user to provide more input.
